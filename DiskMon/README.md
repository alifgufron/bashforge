# Hard Disk Health Monitor Script (harddisk_monitor.sh)

## Version 2.0

### Description

This is a robust and versatile Bash script for monitoring the health of hard disks (both HDD and SSD) using `smartctl`. It is designed to be run automatically as a cron job, providing detailed email reports on disk status, critical SMART attributes, and overall system health.

The script is self-contained, POSIX-compliant, and includes OS detection to ensure compatibility with both Linux and BSD-based systems.

### Key Features

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Automatically detects the OS (Linux or BSD) and uses the appropriate commands for disk discovery (`lsblk` on Linux, `camcontrol` on BSD).
- **Comprehensive SMART Reporting**: Extracts and reports on essential disk health indicators:
    - Overall health status (`PASSED`, `FAILED`).
    - Basic disk identity (Model, Serial Number, Firmware, Capacity).
    - Disk type detection (SSD or HDD).
    - Disk age and usage (`Power_On_Hours`, `Power_Cycle_Count`).
    - Disk temperature.
    - ATA Error Count.
- **Critical Attribute Monitoring**: Specifically tracks critical SMART attributes that are strong predictors of disk failure:
    - `Reallocated_Sector_Ct`
    - `Current_Pending_Sector_Ct`
    - `Offline_Uncorrectable`
    - `UDMA_CRC_Error_Count`
- **SSD & HDD Specific Metrics**: 
    - For **SSDs**, it reports the full `Wear_Leveling_Count` line with a human-readable interpretation of the NAND health percentage, and calculates the total data written (`TBW`).
    - For **HDDs**, it reports the mechanical `Load_Cycle_Count`.
- **Filesystem Usage**: Includes a `df -h` report to give a quick overview of filesystem capacity.
- **Filesystem Usage Warnings**: Generates warnings if any mounted filesystem exceeds a configurable usage threshold (e.g., 90% full).
- **Self-Contained Email Reports**: Generates and sends clear, well-formatted email reports without external script dependencies. The subject line provides an at-a-glance status (`OK`, `WARNING`, or `CRITICAL`).
- **Robust and Safe**: 
    - Uses `set -euo pipefail` for strict error checking.
    - All data extraction commands are designed to be fail-safe to prevent the script from exiting unexpectedly.
    - Employs a sophisticated, conditional timeout mechanism for `smartctl` calls to prevent the script from hanging, adapting to different disk controller types (e.g., SATA, MegaRAID).
    - Allows `smartctl` checks to be optional, enabling `df -h` reports even if `smartctl` is unavailable.

### Prerequisites

- A POSIX-compliant shell (e.g., `bash`, `sh`).
- `smartmontools` (`smartctl` command) must be installed (can be optional, see `REQUIRE_SMARTCTL` in configuration).
- A configured Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) that provides the `sendmail` command.
- `perl` (optional, but recommended on BSD for reliable command timeouts, especially for SATA/ATA disks).
- `bc` for floating-point calculations (used for TBW and age in years).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Place the Script**: Copy `harddisk_monitor.sh` to a suitable location, such as `/usr/local/bin/` or a custom scripts directory.

2.  **Set Permissions**: Make the script executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x harddisk_monitor.sh
    ```

3.  **Configure the Script**: Open `harddisk_monitor.sh` and edit the configuration variables at the top of the file:
    - `REPORT_EMAIL_TO`: The email address to send reports to.
    - `REPORT_EMAIL_FROM`: The "From" address for the email report.
    - `LOG_FILE`: The path to the log file (ensure the directory is writable).
- `DISK_USAGE_WARNING_THRESHOLD`: The percentage of disk usage (e.g., 90) at which a warning will be triggered.
- `REQUIRE_SMARTCTL`: Set to `true` (default) if `smartctl` is a mandatory dependency. Set to `false` if you want the script to proceed with only `df -h` checks when `smartctl` is not available.

### Usage

To run the script manually, simply execute it:

```bash
./harddisk_monitor.sh
```

For automated monitoring, it is highly recommended to run the script as a cron job. For example, to run the check daily at 2 AM, add the following to your crontab (as root):

```crontab
0 2 * * * /path/to/your/harddisk_monitor.sh
```

### Sample Email Report

The email report is formatted for readability and provides a quick summary followed by detailed information for each disk.
